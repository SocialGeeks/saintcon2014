## Title

Teach them to hack... teach them all.

## Description  

I am one of the founders of SocialGeeks, and what I know is that each of us can make a difference. As such, and as technology becomes more prevalent in our lives, it is more important than ever to help form the next generation of hackers. That word has been used as a pejorative, but it is a compliment. Hackers have the power to make the world a better place through technology and curiosity.
 
My involvement in what I'm doing today begin when SocialGeeks, at the time just a college club, organized and facilitated a CTF (Capture The Flag) security competition at one of our local high schools in mid-2013. This first event went well, and, wanting to continue working with the students but not sure how to proceed, we reached out to those in the surrounding area for help.

We already knew that we wanted to set up an informal learning environment for students to learn. While looking into surrounding hackerspaces, a friend referred me to the The Transistor hackerspace and what is now 801 Labs. Though this community of friends and colleagues we learned of SaintCon and decided to share our story.

Last year, SocialGeeks came to SaintCon with six high school students and their computer science instructor. The whole experience was a whirlwind experience. The kids were exposed to browser security, DNS attacks, lock picking, Bronies, Raspberry Pis, and a whole world that they didn't know existed before. Two of these kids even went on stage to tell their story.

It isn't an exaggeration to say that more than one life was changed in the process of experiencing SaintCon. In fact, when they got back home, their instructor and students were so inspired that they immediately began working on transforming a storage room in their high school into a hackerspace for the students.

In this presentation, I will talk about my experience working with those local students, organizations similar to ours, and why you should get involved with forming the next generation of hackers. I am also going to find out if the local high school will once again fund the sending of more students to SaintCon so that we can repeat our successes, and if they do, I'm going to ask some of them to join me in speaking.

Geek power!

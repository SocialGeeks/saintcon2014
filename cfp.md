## Title

Teach them to hack... teach them all.

## Description  

As technology becomes more prevelant in our lives it is more important than ever to help form the next generation of hackers. I am one of the founders of SocialGeeks and believe each of us can make a difference.
 
My involvement doing this begin when SocialGeeks, at the time a college club, organized and facilitated a CTF security competition at one of our local highschools.  This was mid 2013.

This went well and wanting to continue working with the students but not sure how to proceed, we reached out to the surrounding area for help.  We already knew that we wanted to setup an informal learning environment and while looking into surrounding hackerspaces, a friend pointed me at the The Transistor hackerspace and what is now 801 Labs. Though this community we learned of SaintCon and decided to share our story. 

Last year SocialGeeks came to SaintCon with six highschoolers and their computer science instructor. Two of these kids went on stage and told their story. The whole experience was a whirlwind. The kids were exposed to browser security, dns attacks, lock picking, bronies, raspberrypi's and a whole world they didn't know existed. More than one life was changed. Back home, their instructor and students were inspired and immediately started working on transforming a storage room into a hackerspace for the students.

In this presentation I will talk about my experience working with the local students, other similar organizations and why you should get involved with forming the next generation of hackers.

I'm going to find out soon if the local highschool will fund sending some students up again.  If they do I'm going to ask a student or two to come up and talk briefly.

Geek power!
